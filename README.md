#Hacker News Button for Chrome

Forked from <a href="https://github.com/powerpak/hn-sidebar">hn-sidebar</a>, which injected code into pages. 

This version adds a browser button that changes to orange when the current page has been discussed on Hacker News. Click the orange button to open the discussion.
